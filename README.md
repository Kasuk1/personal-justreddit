# JustReddit

This project was planned to be part of my portfolio and will probably receive updates through my learning process. The first requirements were delivered by Codecademy and it's part of my Front-End Enginner Path's curriculum as well.

Now I'm going to divide the entire process followed to the final result of this application. But before that, I will mention some important technologies used in the entire stack (This project start with Front-end objective, probably improved in the future through Back-end).

## Technologies

- HTML, CSS, JS
- SCSS
- React
- Redux / Redux Toolkit
- ReactRouter v6

## Process

Now I'm going to divide the entire process followed to the final result of this application.

### Wireframe

The wireframing of this project was made in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/proto/1u9bH8RhuQ5hcpAIzaiyES/Personal-Project---Reddit-Client?page-id=2%3A29&node-id=885%3A752&viewport=258%2C48%2C0.17&scaling=min-zoom) and was useful to structure the components that will be used in the React project.

Here's an example for [web](https://files.fm/thumb_show.php?i=qnaf2jtzm). And here's one for [mobile](https://files.fm/thumb_show.php?i=adk8buses) devices.

### Prototype

The prototype is medium-fidelity and was made in Figma as well. Does not contain neither animations nor functionality, but have a close approach to the final design to be implemented.

Here's an example for [web](https://files.fm/thumb_show.php?i=f6ejkwkna), you can see that has the structure proposed in the wireframing. The same applied for [mobile](https://files.fm/thumb_show.php?i=wp59f2n5a) devices.

### Front-end

The app is based in React in collaboration with Redux to manage the state. The process to structure the initial files and folders is tough to me but I tried my best at this point and tried to avoid too much code in a single file as well.

The style was made with SCSS without any framework. The structure folder was implemented isolated just for the styles.

Another point is the loading state. With Redux was possible to tracked all the loading state when I made async requests and can have an state for the loaded and rejected state. The loading state's design was purely implemented with SCSS but this wasn't prepared in the wireframe process though.

## Future Work

I will probably implement a Back-end to this app, but before we need to think in something that have sens to be stored. It will be useful to my learning path though.
